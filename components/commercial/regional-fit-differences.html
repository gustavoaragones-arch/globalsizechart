    <p>US sizing tends to be more relaxed; EU and UK often use slimmer cuts. Asian sizing (e.g. Japan, China) frequently runs smaller than US and EU. Shoe size numbers don't align across regions—a US 9 is not the same as a UK 9 or EU 42. Use a conversion chart or converter for your target region and, when possible, the brand's regional size guide.</p>
