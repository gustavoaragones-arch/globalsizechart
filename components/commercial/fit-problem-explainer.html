    <p>Common fit issues—too tight, too long, narrow toe box, or inconsistent between styles—often come from mixing regional sizes or not matching your measurements to the brand's chart. Measuring yourself (foot length for shoes; chest, waist, hips for clothing) and comparing to the product's size guide helps. When between sizes, sizing up usually improves comfort.</p>
