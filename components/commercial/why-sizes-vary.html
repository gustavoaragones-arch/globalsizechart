    <p>Sizing is not standardized globally. Different countries and brands use different base measurements, grading rules, and fit models. EU and Asian sizing often run smaller than US; UK shoe sizes are typically one size down from US. Within a region, brands can still differ. Use conversions as a starting point and always confirm with the retailer's size chart.</p>
