        <h1>How Clothing Sizes Differ Globally</h1>
        <p class="mb-lg">Clothing sizes are not standardized from country to country. A US medium is not the same as a UK or EU medium; Asian sizing often runs smaller than Western sizing. This guide explains how clothing sizes differ globally and how to use converters, measurements, and brand charts to find the right fit.</p>
        <h2>Why clothing sizes vary by region</h2>
        <p>Each region developed its own sizing systems using different base measurements, grading rules, and fit models. US sizing often uses bust, waist, and hip measurements in inches, with letter sizes (XS, S, M, L) and numeric dress or pants sizes. UK sizing uses similar letters and numbers but different underlying dimensions. EU sizing typically uses chest and waist in centimeters and a different numeric scale. Asian markets (e.g. Japan, China, Korea) frequently use smaller base measurements and slimmer cuts, so a Japanese L may be closer to a US or EU S or M. There is no single global standard, so the same number or letter can mean different things. Our <a href="clothing-size-converter.html">Clothing Size Converter</a> helps you translate between regions; the <a href="clothing-size-pages.html">Clothing Size Pages</a> hub lists conversion pages by category.</p>
        <h2>US, UK, and EU differences</h2>
        <p>In the US, women's dress sizes often run in even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8…), while men's shirt sizes may use neck and sleeve length (e.g. 15.5–34). UK dress and shirt sizing uses different number ranges. EU sizing commonly uses a single number derived from chest or waist in cm (e.g. 40, 42). Converting between them requires knowing your size in one system or your body measurements. Use our <a href="clothing-size-converter.html">Clothing Size Converter</a> to get equivalents, and measure your chest, waist, and hips with our <a href="tools/measurement-assistant.html">Measurement Assistant</a> or <a href="printable/clothing-measurement-chart.html">Printable Clothing Measurement Chart</a> for the most accurate baseline. Our <a href="measurement/90cm-chest-to-us-shirt-size.html">measurement-to-size</a> pages (e.g. 90 cm chest to US shirt) show how body measurements map to regional sizes. The <a href="common-sizing-problems.html">Common Sizing Problems</a> guide covers regional mix-ups and how to avoid them.</p>
        <h2>Asian vs Western sizing</h2>
        <p>Many Asian brands use smaller base measurements and narrower cuts than US or EU brands. A Japanese or Korean L may correspond to a US S or M. Brands such as Uniqlo, Shein, and Zara (which uses European sizing but often slimmer fits) are frequently reported to run small; our <a href="brands-that-run-small.html">Brands That Run Small</a> and <a href="brand-size-guides.html">Brand Size Guides</a> hubs link to brand-specific guides. When shopping from Asian retailers or brands that source from Asian factories, use the brand's size chart and consider sizing up if you are between sizes. The <a href="shoe-size-converter.html">Shoe Size Converter</a> and <a href="programmatic-pages/japan-to-us-shoe-size.html">Japan to US Shoe Size</a> page are useful for shoes; for clothing, the <a href="clothing-size-converter.html">Clothing Size Converter</a> and body measurements are the best starting point.</p>
        <h2>Using measurements for the best fit</h2>
        <p>The most reliable way to compare across regions is to use body measurements in centimeters. Measure chest (fullest part), waist (natural waist), and hips (fullest part) and compare them to the brand's size chart. Our <a href="tools/measurement-assistant.html">Measurement Assistant</a> accepts measurements in cm or inches and can suggest size ranges; the <a href="printable/clothing-measurement-chart.html">Printable Clothing Measurement Chart</a> helps you record them. Once you have your measurements, use the <a href="clothing-size-converter.html">Clothing Size Converter</a> and the specific brand's chart. Our <a href="brands/levis-jeans-size-guide.html">Levi's</a>, <a href="brands/zara-clothing-size-guide.html">Zara</a>, and <a href="brands/uniqlo-size-guide.html">Uniqlo</a> guides, among others, show how brands map measurements to sizes. The <a href="measurement-tools.html">Measurement Tools</a> hub and <a href="shoe-sizing-guides.html">Shoe Sizing Guides</a> hub centralize links to all converters and tools.</p>
        <h2>Brand fit on top of regional size</h2>
        <p>Even within one region, brands fit differently. Some run small, others large. After converting your size, check the brand's official chart and our <a href="brands-that-run-small.html">Brands That Run Small</a> and <a href="brands-that-run-large.html">Brands That Run Large</a> overviews. Our <a href="brand-sizing-guide.html">Brand Sizing Guide</a> explains how to use brand charts. When between sizes, size up for brands that run small and consider sizing down for brands that run large, in line with the chart. The <a href="clothing-fit-problems.html">Clothing Fit Problems</a> and <a href="common-sizing-problems.html">Common Sizing Problems</a> pages offer more guidance on avoiding wrong sizes and regional confusion.</p>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Clothing sizes differ globally because there is no single international standard. US, UK, EU, and Asian systems use different base measurements and grading. Use our <a href="clothing-size-converter.html">Clothing Size Converter</a> to translate between regions, and measure your chest, waist, and hips in cm for the best accuracy. Compare your measurements to the brand's size chart. Our <a href="clothing-size-pages.html">Clothing Size Pages</a>, <a href="measurement-tools.html">Measurement Tools</a>, <a href="brand-size-guides.html">Brand Size Guides</a>, and <a href="shoe-sizing-guides.html">Shoe Sizing Guides</a> hubs link to all relevant converters, tools, and guides.</p>
