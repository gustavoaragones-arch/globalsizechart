        <h1>Measurement Guides</h1>
        <p>Accurate measurement is the foundation of correct sizing. Whether you're converting foot length to shoe size or chest and waist to clothing size, starting with a reliable number in centimeters (or inches) removes guesswork and reduces returns. Size labels (US 9, EU 42, M, L) are derived from length or girth; if you don't know your current size in a given region, or if you're buying from a brand that only publishes cm, measuring gives you a universal input. This hub explains why measurement comes first, how foot and body measurements map to sizes, when to use cm versus inches, common measurement mistakes and how to avoid them, and when to re-measure versus relying on a converter. Below we link to converters, programmatic conversion pages, how-to articles, interactive calculators, and printable rulers and sheets—so you can measure once and use the result across any chart or tool.</p>

        <h2>Why Measurement Comes First</h2>
        <p>Size numbers (US 9, EU 42) are derived from length or girth. If you don't know your current size in a given region, or if you're buying from a brand that only publishes cm, measuring gives you a universal input. Foot length in cm maps to men's, women's, and kids' shoe sizes across regions; chest, waist, and hip in cm map to clothing sizes. Once you have those numbers, you can use any chart or converter. Measuring also catches changes: feet and body can change with age, weight, or activity, so re-measuring periodically improves accuracy.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>How Foot and Body Measurements Map to Sizes</h2>
        <p><strong>Foot length</strong> (heel to longest toe, in cm) is the standard input for shoe size conversion. Charts and formulas assign a US, UK, EU, or Japan size to each length (or half-length). <strong>Body measurements</strong>—chest, waist, hips, sometimes inseam and sleeve—are compared to a size chart's ranges to pick a clothing size. There is no single "official" mapping; different publishers and brands use slightly different tables. Our tools and charts use widely accepted reference data; for critical fits, compare your measurement to the brand's own chart when available.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>When to Measure in CM vs Inches</h2>
        <p>Most international size charts and converters use <strong>centimeters</strong>. If you measure in inches, convert (1 inch = 2.54 cm) or use a tool that accepts both. Our <a href="tools/measurement-assistant.html">Measurement Assistant</a> and <a href="foot-measurement-calculator.html">Foot Measurement Calculator</a> support cm and inches. For consistency and to match EU/Asian charts, measuring in cm is simplest. Printable rulers and foot-measuring sheets on this site are in cm; print at 100% scale for accuracy.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Avoiding Common Measurement Mistakes</h2>
        <p>Measure feet in the evening when they're slightly larger; stand with weight even; use the larger foot. For clothing, keep the tape snug but not compressing, and parallel to the floor. Don't assume an old size is still correct. Using a stretched or inaccurate ruler, or measuring over thick clothing, skews results. Our <a href="how-to-measure-feet.html">How to Measure Your Feet</a> and printable sheets walk you through step-by-step. Once you have a good number, store it and use it with any converter or chart.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>When to Use a Converter vs Measuring Again</h2>
        <p>Use a <strong>converter</strong> when you already have a size in one region or a measurement in cm and need the equivalent size elsewhere. Use <strong>measurement</strong> when you've never sized yourself, your size may have changed, or you're switching to a system that relies on cm. If you're unsure, measure: it takes a few minutes and gives you a reliable baseline. Below we list converters, programmatic conversion pages, how-to guides, interactive calculators, and printables so you can measure once and convert with confidence.</p>
