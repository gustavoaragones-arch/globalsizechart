        <h1>The Complete Global Size Chart Guide</h1>
        <p>Ordering shoes or clothing across borders means facing a patchwork of size systems: US, UK, EU, Japan, and others, each with different numbers and letters for the same body or foot. This guide is the most comprehensive resource on the site. It covers how size systems came to be, how they differ by region and category, how width and measurement fit in, why brands vary, how kids sizing works, what printable charts are for, and how to use conversion tools. For the authority anchor on <em>why</em> systems differ (history, Mondopoint, EU≠UK≠US, standardization limits), see our <a href="international-sizing-system.html">International Sizing System</a>. For how <strong>width</strong> affects fit (length vs width, when shoes feel tight on the sides), see our <a href="understanding-shoe-width.html">Understanding Shoe Width</a> guide. Use the sections below to understand the landscape; use our <a href="shoe-size-guides.html">Shoe Size Guides</a>, <a href="clothing-size-guides.html">Clothing Size Guides</a>, <a href="brand-sizing-guides.html">Brand Sizing Guides</a>, and <a href="measurement-guides.html">Measurement Guides</a> hubs for direct links to converters, tools, and printables.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>History of size systems</h2>
        <p>Modern sizing did not start from a single global standard. In the UK, one story has it that King Edward II decreed the inch to be the length of three barleycorns, and UK shoe sizes later used barleycorn steps—so a size was literally “so many barleycorns” of length. In reality, sizing evolved regionally. The US developed its own numeric scales for men’s, women’s, and children’s shoes, with different zero points and step sizes. Continental Europe adopted the Paris point (often said to be ⅔ of a centimeter per size), which produced the EU numbering we see today. Japan and China developed or adopted cm-based or EU-like systems. Clothing sizing grew out of tailoring and ready-to-wear in each market: chest, waist, and hip measurements were translated into letters (S, M, L) or numbers (34, 36, 38) with no international agreement.</p>
        <p>The result is that a “9” or “42” or “M” means something different depending on country and category. Conversion charts and tools exist precisely because of this history—they map between systems using agreed reference lengths or measurements. Industry bodies and standards organizations have tried to harmonize sizing (e.g. ISO for shoe length in cm), but legacy labels remain in daily use. Understanding that there was never one world standard helps explain why conversion is essential and why a single “true” size number does not exist across regions. When you shop across borders, treating your “home” size as fixed and looking up the equivalent in the target system is the practical approach.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>EU vs US vs UK vs JP explained</h2>
        <p><strong>US</strong> shoe sizes use separate scales for men, women, and kids. Men’s sizes typically run from about 6 to 14 (or higher) in whole and half sizes; women’s run about 1.5–2 numbers higher for the same foot length (e.g. the same length might be US 9 men’s or US 10.5 women’s). Kids have their own progression (e.g. 1C–13C, then 1Y–7Y) before overlapping with adult. <strong>UK</strong> sizes are usually about one size down from US men’s (e.g. US 9 ≈ UK 8). UK women’s and kids’ scales also differ from US. <strong>EU</strong> (Paris point) sizes use a formula tied to foot length in cm and produce numbers in the mid-30s to mid-40s for adults—so EU 42 is roughly a US men’s 9. EU does not use separate men’s/women’s numbers in the same way; the same EU size might be used for a given length. <strong>Japan</strong> often uses cm-based sizing (e.g. 24, 25, 26 cm) or a scale that aligns loosely with EU. China may use EU-like numbers or local standards. Because the scales have different starting points and step sizes, you cannot assume “US 9 = UK 9 = EU 9.” Use our <a href="shoe-size-converter.html">shoe size converter</a> or <a href="cm-to-us-shoe-size.html">CM to US shoe size</a> tool and always select the correct gender and region. For detailed breakdowns, see our <a href="shoe-size-guides.html">Shoe Size Guides</a> and articles on <a href="semantic/why-eu-and-us-sizes-differ.html">why EU and US differ</a> and <a href="semantic/how-uk-shoe-sizes-differ.html">how UK sizes differ</a>.</p>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Shoe vs clothing sizing differences</h2>
        <p>Shoe sizing is driven primarily by <strong>foot length</strong> (and in some markets, width). One number or code per foot gives you a size. Clothing sizing is driven by <strong>body measurements</strong>: chest, waist, hips, and often inseam or sleeve length. A single garment may be described by several measurements, and the same “M” or “38” can correspond to different chest/waist/hip ranges in the US, UK, or EU. Shoe systems are more numeric and consistent within a region (e.g. US men’s 7, 7.5, 8); clothing often mixes letters (XS–XXL) and numbers (e.g. 32, 34 for pants) and the mapping between letter and measurement varies by brand. Another key difference: shoe conversion is often “one number in, one number out” (e.g. 26 cm → US 9), whereas clothing conversion may depend on garment type—tops, pants, dresses, and outerwear can have different size progressions. Our <a href="clothing-size-converter.html">clothing size converter</a> and <a href="shoe-size-converter.html">shoe size converter</a> handle each category; the <a href="tools/measurement-assistant.html">Measurement Assistant</a> does both foot and body measurements in one place. For more on clothing, see <a href="clothing-size-guides.html">Clothing Size Guides</a> and <a href="how-clothing-sizes-differ-globally.html">how clothing sizes differ globally</a>.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Width systems globally</h2>
        <p>Length is only half the story for shoes. <strong>Width</strong>—narrow, standard, wide—is expressed differently around the world. In the US, men’s standard width is usually “D” and women’s “B,” with “2E” or “EE” for wide and “B” or “C” for narrow in men’s. UK and EU sometimes use letters or terms like “narrow” and “wide” without a single universal code. Not every brand offers multiple widths; athletic and work brands (e.g. New Balance, ASICS) often do. If your feet are wide or narrow, using length alone can leave you in the wrong fit.</p>
        <p>Measure the circumference around the widest part of your foot (the ball) and use our <a href="foot-width-calculator.html">foot width calculator</a> with your length to see if you fall into narrow, standard, or wide—and which US width letter that implies. Then filter by width when shopping. Our <a href="foot-width-guide.html">Foot Width Guide</a> explains where and how to measure; <a href="understanding-shoe-width.html">Understanding Shoe Width</a> covers why size alone isn't enough and when length is right but the shoe still feels wrong. In many countries, width is not printed on the box; the shoe is assumed “standard.” If you have had consistent fit issues (pinching, slipping, or needing to size up for room), width is often the cause. Clothing width is usually baked into the cut (slim, regular, relaxed) rather than a separate width code, though some brands offer “wide” or “narrow” in specific categories such as shoes or pants.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Measurement-based sizing</h2>
        <p>The most reliable input for conversion is a <strong>physical measurement</strong>: foot length in cm for shoes, chest/waist/hips in cm (or inches) for clothing. Size numbers (US 9, EU 42) are derived from such measurements; if you don’t know your current size in a given region, or the brand only publishes cm, measuring gives you a universal starting point. For feet, measure from heel to longest toe on both feet and use the larger value; do it in the evening when feet are slightly larger. For clothing, use a soft tape and keep it horizontal and snug but not tight. Our <a href="how-to-measure-feet.html">How to Measure Your Feet</a> and <a href="how-to-measure-in-cm.html">How to Measure in CM</a> guides, plus the <a href="printable/foot-measuring-sheet.html">printable foot measuring sheet</a> and <a href="printable/cm-ruler.html">printable cm ruler</a>, support accurate measurement. Once you have a length or body measurement, plug it into our <a href="foot-measurement-calculator.html">foot measurement calculator</a>, <a href="kids-growth-size-calculator.html">kids growth size calculator</a>, or <a href="tools/measurement-assistant.html">Measurement Assistant</a> to get US, UK, EU, and other sizes. The <a href="measurement-guides.html">Measurement Guides</a> hub ties together all measurement-based resources.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Brand sizing variability</h2>
        <p>Even with an accurate conversion, <strong>brands differ</strong>. One brand’s US 9 might fit like another’s 9.5. This is because brands use different lasts (shoe molds), fit models, and grading. Some run small (e.g. many athletic or Asian-market brands); some run large. Our <a href="brand-sizing-guides.html">Brand Sizing Guides</a> hub and individual pages (e.g. <a href="brands/nike-size-guide.html">Nike</a>, <a href="brands/adidas-size-guide.html">Adidas</a>, <a href="brands/zara-size-guide.html">Zara</a>, <a href="brands/hm-size-guide.html">H&M</a>) describe fit tendencies. Articles on <a href="brands-that-run-small.html">brands that run small</a> and <a href="brands-that-run-large.html">brands that run large</a> summarize common patterns. Best practice: get your baseline size from a converter or measurement tool, then check the brand’s official size chart for the product. If the brand runs small, consider sizing up; if it runs large, you may size down. When in doubt, order two sizes if returns are easy. See also our <a href="brand-sizing-guide.html">Brand Sizing Guide</a> for how to use brand charts with conversion.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Kids sizing complexities</h2>
        <p>Kids shoe and clothing sizing adds another layer. <strong>Kids shoe</strong> scales are separate from adult: US uses small numbers (e.g. 10C, 11C) then “youth” (1Y–7Y) before overlapping with adult. EU and UK have kids progressions too. The same foot length in cm maps to different “kids” sizes than “adult” sizes. Children’s feet grow quickly, so re-measuring every few months is important. Use our <a href="kids-growth-size-calculator.html">kids growth size calculator</a> and <a href="printable/kids-size-guide.html">kids printable shoe size guide</a>; leave a little room for growth but not so much that the shoe slips. A thumb’s width of space at the toe is a common rule of thumb.</p>
        <p><strong>Kids clothing</strong> may use age (e.g. 4Y, 8Y), height (e.g. 110, 120 cm), or EU-style numbers. Conversion between regions is again approximate, and growth spurts mean that age-based sizes can be off. When possible, use actual measurements (height, chest, waist) against the brand’s size chart. The <a href="shoe-size-guides.html">Shoe Size Guides</a> and <a href="printable-size-charts.html">Printable Size Charts</a> hubs link to kids-specific tools and printables.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Printable charts explained</h2>
        <p><strong>Printable</strong> size charts and measuring aids let you work offline or keep a reference at home. We offer a <a href="printable/foot-measuring-sheet.html">foot measuring sheet</a> (instructions plus space to mark and measure), a <a href="printable/cm-ruler.html">printable cm ruler</a> (print at 100% scale for accuracy), a <a href="printable/shoe-size-reference-chart.html">EU/US shoe size reference chart</a>, a <a href="printable/kids-size-guide.html">kids shoe size guide</a>, and a <a href="printable/clothing-measurement-chart.html">clothing measurement chart</a>. Print or save as PDF and use with our converters: measure with the sheet or ruler, then enter the value into the <a href="shoe-size-converter.html">shoe</a> or <a href="clothing-size-converter.html">clothing</a> converter. The <a href="printable-size-charts.html">Printable Size Charts</a> and <a href="printable-size-guides.html">Printable Size Guides</a> hubs list all of these. Printable charts are especially useful for at-home measuring and for sharing with family or a fitter.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Why do shoe sizes differ between countries?</h3>
          <p>Different countries developed their own sizing systems at different times. The UK used barleycorns; the US and EU created separate scales. There is no single global standard, so conversion charts map between systems using agreed reference foot lengths in cm.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Is EU size the same as US size for shoes?</h3>
          <p>No. EU numbers are typically about 1 to 1.5 larger than US men's for the same foot length (e.g. US 9 ≈ EU 42–42.5). Women's and kids' scales also differ. Always use a converter and select the correct category.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How do I measure my foot for shoe size?</h3>
          <p>Place paper against a wall on a hard floor, stand with your heel to the wall, mark the tip of your longest toe, and measure from wall to mark in cm. Use the larger foot. See our <a href="how-to-measure-feet.html">how-to-measure guides</a> and use the <a href="foot-measurement-calculator.html">foot measurement calculator</a> or <a href="printable/foot-measuring-sheet.html">printable foot sheet</a>.</p>

          <h3>What is the difference between shoe and clothing sizing?</h3>
          <p>Shoe sizing is based mainly on foot length (and sometimes width). Clothing uses body measurements: chest, waist, hips, inseam. Shoe systems use numeric or alphanumeric scales; clothing uses letters (XS–XXL) and/or numbers that vary by region and garment type.</p>

          <h3>Should I use cm or inches for sizing?</h3>
          <p>Centimeters are the standard for international sizing. Most charts and our tools use cm. If you have inches, multiply by 2.54 to get cm. Our tools accept both where applicable.</p>

          <h3>Why do my shoes feel tight when the length is right?</h3>
          <p>Shoe size charts convert <strong>length only</strong>. Tightness on the sides or at the ball usually means <strong>width</strong> or last shape—your foot may be wider than the standard width for that size. See our <a href="understanding-shoe-width.html">Understanding Shoe Width</a> guide and use the <a href="foot-width-calculator.html">Foot Width Calculator</a> to find your width; then choose wide-width styles or brands that offer multiple widths.</p>
