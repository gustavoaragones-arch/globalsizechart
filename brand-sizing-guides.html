        <h1>Brand Sizing Guides</h1>
        <p>Even after you know your "standard" size in US, UK, or EU, brands often deviate. Nike may run narrow; Zara may run small; Levi's jeans have their own waist and length logic. Generic conversion charts give you a starting point, but they cannot account for each brand's fit model, last, or grading. This hub ties together brand-specific guides, conversion tools, and fit strategy: how to use conversion charts and your own measurements together with a brand's size chart, when to size up or down, and when to trust the brand chart over a converter. Below you'll find converters to get your baseline size, programmatic conversion pages for regional pairs, articles on brands that run small or large and common sizing problems, calculators and the Measurement Assistant, printables, and direct links to our dedicated pages for Nike, Adidas, Zara, H&M, New Balance, and others.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>How Brand Sizing Differs From Standard Charts</h2>
        <p>Standard conversion charts assume an "average" last or block. Brands use their own fit models, target markets, and grading. A brand may design for a narrower heel, a roomier toe box, or a longer inseam. So your converted "US 9" or "EU 42" is a starting point—not a guarantee. Brand size guides and our dedicated brand pages describe whether that brand tends to run true to size, small, or large, and in which categories (e.g. running vs lifestyle). Always cross-check the brand's official size chart for the product you're buying.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Why Some Brands Run Small or Large</h2>
        <p>Design intent, manufacturing tolerances, and market expectations all play a role. Athletic brands may build in more room for movement; fashion brands may cut slimmer. Asian-market or fast-fashion lines often run smaller than US/EU equivalents. "Running small" usually means you need to size up from your usual number; "running large" means you might size down. Our articles on <a href="brands-that-run-small.html">brands that run small</a> and <a href="brands-that-run-large.html">brands that run large</a> summarize common patterns. Combined with your measured size and the brand's chart, you can make a better choice.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Using Conversion With Brand Charts</h2>
        <p>Step 1: Get your baseline size from our <a href="shoe-size-converter.html">shoe</a> or <a href="clothing-size-converter.html">clothing</a> converter (using your measurement or current size). Step 2: Open the brand's size guide for the specific item. Step 3: Compare the chart's measurements (e.g. foot length in cm, chest in cm) to your numbers. If the brand runs small, consider the next size up; if it runs large, you may be able to go down. Step 4: When possible, read recent reviews for fit notes. This hub links to both generic converters and our brand-specific guides so you can do both in one place.</p>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>When to Trust the Brand Chart Over a Converter</h2>
        <p>Converters are best for translating between regions (e.g. "What is US 9 in EU?"). For final purchase decisions, the brand's own chart is authoritative: it reflects how that product was graded. If the brand lists foot length in cm or body measurements per size, use those. If the brand only shows US or EU sizes, use our converter to get the equivalent, then apply any "runs small/large" guidance from our brand guides or reviews. Below we list all brand guides plus converters, articles, tools, and printables in one place.</p>
