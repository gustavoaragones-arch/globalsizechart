        <h1>Shoe Size Guides</h1>
        <p>Understanding shoe sizes across regions is the first step to ordering the right fit. US, UK, EU, Japan, and China each use different numbering systems and reference lengths, so a "9" in one country is not the same as a "9" in another. Shopping across borders or buying from brands that label in a single region makes conversion essential—and getting it wrong means returns, discomfort, or wasted money. This hub brings together everything you need: an explanation of how international shoe sizing works, why sizes differ between regions and brands, how width systems fit in, and when to rely on a conversion chart versus measuring your feet. Below the guide you'll find converters for quick lookups, programmatic conversion pages for specific size pairs, in-depth articles on measurement and regional differences, interactive calculators, and printable charts. Use the content above to build your understanding; use the links below to convert, measure, and print.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>How International Shoe Sizing Systems Work</h2>
        <p>Most systems are built on a standard foot length, usually in centimeters or a regional last. The <strong>US</strong> system uses different scales for men, women, and kids: men's sizes start around 1 and step in half sizes; women's run about 1.5–2 sizes higher for the same length. <strong>UK</strong> sizes are typically one size down from US men's (e.g. US 9 ≈ UK 8). <strong>EU</strong> (Paris point) sizes use a formula based on length in cm and produce numbers in the mid-30s to mid-40s for adults. <strong>Japan</strong> and <strong>China</strong> often use cm-based or EU-like numbering. Because there is no single global standard, conversion charts and tools map one system to another using agreed reference lengths; small variations exist between chart publishers and brands. Kids' sizes follow yet another scale and transition into adult sizing around the early teens.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Why Sizes Differ Between Regions</h2>
        <p>Historical standards, last shapes, and target markets all contribute. The UK and US diverged early; EU adopted the Paris point. Manufacturing hubs (e.g. Asia) may label in EU or local cm. Brands also "grade" sizes differently—some add more toe room, others build snugger. So even after converting, a US 9 in one brand can fit like a US 9.5 in another. Knowing your <em>foot length in cm</em> gives you a stable reference: you can compare any size table or chart to that number and see which regional size corresponds, then adjust for brand if needed.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Width Systems Explained</h2>
        <p>Length is only half the story. Width (narrow, standard, wide) is expressed differently by region. In the US, men's standard width is often "D" and women's "B," with "2E" or "EE" for wide and "B" or "C" for narrow in men's. UK and EU sometimes use single letters or terms like "narrow" and "wide" without a universal code. Not every style comes in multiple widths; athletic and work brands (e.g. New Balance, ASICS) often offer more width options. If you need wide or narrow, use our <a href="foot-width-calculator.html">foot width calculator</a> and then filter by width when shopping.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Common Sizing Mistakes</h2>
        <p>Assuming US and EU are the same number, guessing without measuring, or using the wrong gender/category (men's vs women's vs kids) leads to wrong sizes. Measuring in the morning when feet are smaller, or using a too-short ruler, also causes errors. Many people forget to measure both feet and use the larger; others ignore width and blame "bad sizing" when the length was right but the shoe was too narrow. Best practice: measure both feet in the evening, use the larger length, and convert with a chart or tool that asks for gender and region. For kids, use a kids-specific chart or calculator because the scale is different from adult sizes.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>When to Use a Conversion Chart vs Measurement</h2>
        <p>Use a <strong>conversion chart or converter</strong> when you already know your size in one region (e.g. US 9) and need the equivalent in another (e.g. EU 42). Use <strong>measurement</strong> when you don't know your size, your feet have changed, or you're buying from a brand that only lists cm. Measuring gives you a number (e.g. 26 cm) that you can plug into any converter or chart; it's the most reliable baseline. Below we link to both: converters and programmatic conversion pages for quick lookups, and measurement guides, calculators, and printables for when you start from foot length.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Converters</h2>
        <p>Use these tools when you know a size in one region and need the equivalent in another, or when you have a foot length in cm and want US, UK, EU, or Japan sizes in one step. The main shoe size converter accepts any input; the CM and regional converters are quick lookups for common pairs.</p>
