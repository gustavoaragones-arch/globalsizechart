        <h2>Sizing differences</h2>
        <p><strong>Zara</strong> uses European (Spanish) sizing. Dresses, tops, and pants are frequently cut slim; many US and UK shoppers find that their usual “converted” size feels tight and that they need one size up. For example, if you’re usually a US women’s 8 or M, a Zara 38 might fit, but 40 is often safer. Zara’s size charts are per category—always check the product page. Shoes follow EU numbering and can run narrow; half a size up is common.</p>
        <p><strong>H&M</strong> also uses EU sizing (Swedish). Conversion to US/UK varies by category. Many lines run small; “size up at H&M” is common advice. That said, H&M has many sub-brands and fits (e.g. relaxed, slim), so one item may be true to size while another runs small. Men’s and kids’ sizing can be slightly more generous than women’s in some ranges, but overall both brands sit on the “runs small” side compared with typical US expectations.</p>
        <p>In practice: <strong>Zara tends to run smaller and slimmer than H&M.</strong> A Zara M might feel like an H&M S in similar styles. Use the <a href="clothing-size-converter.html">clothing size converter</a> to get your EU equivalent, then consider going one size up for both—and when in doubt, check the brand’s chart.
