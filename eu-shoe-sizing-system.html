        <h1>EU Shoe Sizing System</h1>
        <p>The European shoe sizing system—often called the <strong>Paris point</strong> or continental system—is used across most of Europe and in many brands worldwide. Unlike US and UK systems, EU sizing is tied directly to foot length via a simple formula, and it does not use separate number scales for men and women for the same length. This guide explains how EU sizes work, how they convert to US, UK, and Japan, how width is handled, and where to find exact conversions on this site.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>How the EU (Paris Point) System Works</h2>
        <p>EU shoe size is derived from the length of the foot in centimeters. The standard formula is:</p>
        <p><strong>EU size = (foot length in cm × 1.5) − 2</strong></p>
        <p>So each full EU size step corresponds to about ⅔ of a centimeter (two-thirds of a cm) in foot length. For example, a foot that measures 27 cm gives roughly EU 38.5; 28 cm gives about EU 40. The system has a single numeric scale for adults: typical ranges are about EU 35–40 for smaller women’s sizes, 38–44 for average men’s, and 44–48+ for larger men’s. Because the scale is length-based and unisex in principle, the same EU number can appear on both men’s and women’s shoes when the internal length is the same—though in practice brands often separate men’s and women’s lines and may label them the same EU size for different foot lengths.</p>
        <p>Half sizes are common in Europe (e.g. 41, 41.5, 42). Not every brand offers them; when they do, conversion to US or UK half sizes is more accurate. For precise conversions from your foot length, use our <a href="foot-measurement-calculator.html">Foot Measurement Calculator</a> or <a href="cm-to-us-shoe-size.html">CM to US Shoe Size</a> tool, then cross-check with the <a href="shoe-size-converter.html">Shoe Size Converter</a>.</p>

        <h2>EU to US, UK, and Japan: Conversion Examples</h2>
        <p>Conversion between EU and other systems is based on matching foot length. Slight differences exist between charts; below are typical equivalents.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>EU 40</strong> → about US men’s 7, UK 6.5; see <a href="programmatic-pages/eu-40-to-us-shoe-size.html">EU 40 to US</a>, <a href="programmatic-pages/eu-40-to-uk-shoe-size.html">EU 40 to UK</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>EU 42</strong> → about US men’s 9, UK 8; see <a href="programmatic-pages/eu-42-to-us-shoe-size.html">EU 42 to US</a>, <a href="programmatic-pages/eu-42-to-uk-shoe-size.html">EU 42 to UK</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>EU 44</strong> → about US men’s 11, UK 10; see <a href="programmatic-pages/eu-44-to-us-shoe-size.html">EU 44 to US</a>, <a href="programmatic-pages/eu-44-to-uk-shoe-size.html">EU 44 to UK</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>EU 38 (women’s)</strong> → about US women’s 7.5–8, UK 5.5–6; <a href="programmatic-pages/eu-38-to-us-shoe-size.html">EU 38 to US</a>, <a href="programmatic-pages/eu-38-to-uk-shoe-size-women.html">EU 38 to UK (women)</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For Japan, sizes are often in cm (e.g. 26 cm). EU 42 is close to Japan 26–27 cm. Use our <a href="programmatic-pages/eu-42-to-jp-shoe-size.html">EU 42 to Japan</a> and other <a href="programmatic-index.html">programmatic index</a> pages for single-size lookups. The main <a href="shoe-size-converter.html">Shoe Size Converter</a>, <a href="us-to-eu-size.html">US to EU Size</a>, and <a href="uk-to-us-size.html">UK to US Size</a> pages cover multiple regions at once.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Width in EU Sizing</h2>
        <p>European width is less standardized than in the US. Many EU brands assume a “standard” width (sometimes marked F) and only offer wide (e.g. G) or narrow (E) in selected styles. There is no single EU-wide letter system like US (B, D, E, EE). If you have wide or narrow feet, check the brand’s size chart for width options and consider using our <a href="foot-width-calculator.html">Foot Width Calculator</a> and <a href="foot-width-guide.html">Foot Width Guide</a> to see how you compare to standard assumptions. When converting EU to US, the length conversion is primary; width still depends on the specific brand and last.</p>

          <h3>How do I convert EU to UK shoe size?</h3>
          <p>UK is typically about one to one and a half sizes lower than EU for the same foot length (e.g. EU 42 ≈ UK 8).

          <h3>What about EU shoe width?</h3>
          <p>EU width is often shown as standard (F), narrow (E), or wide (G). Some brands use numbers or letters; it's less standardized than US width (B, D, E, etc.). Use our <a href="foot-width-calculator.html">foot width calculator</a> to see where you fall and check the brand's size chart.</p>
