        <h1>Understanding Shoe Width &amp; How It Affects Fit</h1>
        <p>Shoe size charts and converters use <strong>length</strong> (heel to toe) to give you a size. Real-world fit also depends on <strong>width</strong>—the space across the ball of your foot—and on the shoe’s last (shape). This page explains how width affects fit, when length is right but the shoe still feels wrong, how to measure and interpret width, and how to use our <a href="foot-width-calculator.html">Foot Width Calculator</a> and <a href="foot-width-guide.html">Foot Width Guide</a>. For the full picture on global sizing, see our <a href="complete-global-size-chart-guide.html">Complete Global Size Chart Guide</a> and <a href="shoe-size-guides.html">Shoe Size Guides</a> hub.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Length vs width</h2>
        <p>Conversion charts map foot length in cm to US, UK, EU, or Japan sizes. That gives you a <strong>length-based size</strong>. Width is separate: two people with the same foot length can have different widths. If your length size is correct but shoes feel tight on the sides, pinch at the ball, or cause rubbing, width or last shape is usually the reason. Sizing up can add a bit of width but also extra length, which can cause slipping. The better approach is to find your width (narrow, standard, or wide) and choose brands or styles that offer that width. Our <a href="shoe-size-converter.html">Shoe Size Converter</a> and <a href="cm-to-us-shoe-size.html">CM to US Shoe Size</a> tools give you length-based size; use the <a href="foot-width-calculator.html">Foot Width Calculator</a> to see where you sit on width.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>US width letters explained</h2>
        <p>In the United States, width is often printed on the box or product page. For <strong>men's</strong> shoes, standard width is <strong>D</strong>. Narrow widths are typically B or C; wide widths are 2E (or EE), 4E, and sometimes 6E for extra wide. For <strong>women's</strong> shoes, standard is usually <strong>B</strong>; narrow can be A or 2A, and wide 2E or 4E. These letters refer to the width of the shoe at the ball of the foot. A length-based conversion (e.g. US 9 from our <a href="foot-measurement-calculator.html">Foot Measurement Calculator</a>) does not tell you whether you need D or 2E; that depends on your actual foot width. Not all brands offer multiple widths; athletic and work brands (New Balance, ASICS, some Brooks) often do.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Measuring width at home</h2>
        <p>To know if you need narrow, standard, or wide shoes, measure the <strong>circumference around the widest part of your foot</strong>—usually across the ball, behind the toes. Use a flexible tape measure or a string plus a ruler; record the result in centimeters. Stand with weight even on both feet when measuring. Our <a href="foot-width-guide.html">Foot Width Guide</a> has step-by-step instructions and a simple diagram. Once you have length (heel to longest toe) and ball circumference, enter both into the <a href="foot-width-calculator.html">Foot Width Calculator</a> to get a width recommendation and the corresponding US width letter. For length-only measurement, use <a href="how-to-measure-feet.html">How to Measure Your Feet</a> and the <a href="printable/foot-measuring-sheet.html">printable foot measuring sheet</a>.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>How width affects fit</h2>
        <p>In the US, men’s standard width is often “D” and women’s “B”; “2E” or “EE” is wide, and “B” or “C” can be narrow for men. EU and UK use different labels or assume “standard.” If you have wide feet, a length-only conversion can leave you in shoes that are long enough but too narrow. If you have narrow feet, standard shoes may feel loose. Knowing your width lets you filter by width when shopping and avoid the “length is right, fit is wrong” problem.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>When length is right but the shoe feels wrong</h2>
        <p>If shoes feel tight on the sides even when the length is correct, <strong>width or last shape</strong> may be the reason. Some brands use narrow lasts; others are roomier. Athletic and work brands (e.g. New Balance, ASICS) often offer multiple widths. Use our <a href="foot-width-calculator.html">Foot Width Calculator</a> with your length and ball circumference to see if you fall into narrow, standard, or wide—and which US width letter that implies. Our <a href="foot-width-guide.html">Foot Width Guide</a> explains where and how to measure. If you already know your size from a converter, that size is length-based; add width into the picture when you shop.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Last shape and brand fit</h2>
        <p>The <strong>last</strong> is the mold a shoe is built on. Brands use different lasts, so the same US 9 in one brand can feel narrower or wider than in another. A length conversion gives you a starting size; it does not account for whether that brand runs narrow or wide. Reading fit reviews and checking whether the brand offers width options helps. Our <a href="brand-sizing-guides.html">Brand Sizing Guides</a> hub and individual brand pages (e.g. <a href="brands/nike-size-guide.html">Nike</a>, <a href="brands/adidas-size-guide.html">Adidas</a>) describe fit tendencies. When in doubt, order two sizes if returns are easy, or stick to brands that offer wide or narrow widths.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>When to size up vs choose wide</h2>
        <p>If you need more room across the ball, <strong>wide width</strong> (e.g. 2E) is usually better than sizing up. Sizing up increases length as well as a little width, which can lead to heel slip or a floppy fit. When a brand doesn't offer wide widths, going up half or one size is a common workaround—then rely on the brand's fit notes and reviews. Kids' shoes often don't have separate width codes; if your child's feet are wide, look for brands that run roomy or size up slightly. See our <a href="kids-growth-size-calculator.html">Kids Growth &amp; Shoe Size Calculator</a> for length-based kids sizing.</p>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Width by region (US, UK, EU)</h2>
        <p>In the <strong>US</strong>, width letters (D, 2E, etc.) are common for men's and women's shoes. In the <strong>UK</strong> and <strong>EU</strong>, many shoes are sold without a width label—they are assumed "standard." Some European brands use terms like "narrow" or "wide" or offer different fit lines. When buying from the UK or EU, your length-based conversion (e.g. from our <a href="us-to-eu-size.html">US to EU Size</a> or <a href="uk-to-us-size.html">UK to US Size</a> converters) still applies to length; width may not be listed, so rely on reviews and brand fit guides. Our <a href="eu-shoe-sizing-system.html">EU</a>, <a href="us-shoe-sizing-system.html">US</a>, and <a href="uk-shoe-sizing-system.html">UK</a> shoe sizing system pages explain each region in more detail.</p>
