        <h1>Disclaimer</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 2025</p>

        <h2>Informational Purpose</h2>
        <p>GlobalSizeChart.com is an informational website designed to provide size conversion guidance for shoes and clothing between different international sizing systems. Our tools and content are intended to assist users in understanding size relationships between regions, but should be used as a reference point rather than an absolute guarantee of fit.</p>

        <h2>Size Conversion Accuracy</h2>
        <p>The size conversions provided on this website are based on standard international sizing conventions and industry-standard conversion tables. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of any specific conversion for the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sizing standards vary between manufacturers and brands, even within the same region</li>
          <li>Individual body proportions and fit preferences differ significantly</li>
          <li>Clothing and shoe fit can be affected by material, design, and manufacturing processes</li>
          <li>Regional sizing systems are not perfectly standardized and may have historical variations</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Brand Sizing Variability</h2>
        <p>One of the most important factors to understand is that sizing varies significantly between brands. A size "Medium" from one brand may fit differently than a size "Medium" from another brand, even within the same country. This variability exists because:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Brands use different fit models and design philosophies</li>
          <li>Some brands employ "vanity sizing" (labeling items with smaller sizes than actual measurements)</li>
          <li>Manufacturing tolerances and quality control standards differ</li>
          <li>Design intent (slim fit, regular fit, oversized) affects actual measurements</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>We strongly recommend checking brand-specific size charts when available, as these provide the most accurate guidance for that particular brand.</strong></p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>GlobalSizeChart.com, its operators, and contributors are not responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Incorrect size selections made based on our conversion tools</li>
          <li>Purchases that do not fit as expected</li>
          <li>Financial losses resulting from size-related returns or exchanges</li>
          <li>Any inconvenience or dissatisfaction with products purchased based on our size conversions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Users of this website acknowledge that size conversion is an approximation and that final size selection decisions are the user's responsibility.</p>

        <h2>Best Practices</h2>
        <p>To maximize your chances of getting the right size when shopping internationally, we recommend:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Using our conversion tools as a starting point, not a definitive answer</li>
          <li>Checking the brand's official size chart when available</li>
          <li>Reading customer reviews for fit information</li>
          <li>Measuring yourself accurately using our measurement guides</li>
          <li>When possible, ordering multiple sizes and returning what doesn't fit</li>
          <li>Considering your personal fit preferences (slim, regular, oversized)</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>No Professional Advice</h2>
        <p>The information provided on GlobalSizeChart.com is for general informational purposes only. It does not constitute professional sizing advice, fashion consultation, or any other form of professional service. For specific sizing questions related to medical conditions, custom fitting, or specialized needs, please consult with appropriate professionals.</p>
